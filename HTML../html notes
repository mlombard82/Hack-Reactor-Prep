Some elements have very precise meaning, as in "this is an image", "this is a heading", or "this is an ordered list." 
Others are less specific, such as "this is a section on the page" or "this is part of the text." Yet others are used for
technical reasons, such as "this is identifying information for the page, so do not display it." Regardless, in one way 
or another all HTML elements have a semantic value.
