IIFE - Immediately invoked function expressions.

var foo = "foo";

(function(){
  var foo = "foo2";
  console.log(foo);      //"foo2"
})();

console.log(foo);        // "foo"

The Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) Pattern is a technique used to hide scope. It involves wrapping code
inside a function that is immediately called. This allows developers to create object in their own scope without polluting
the outer scope.
