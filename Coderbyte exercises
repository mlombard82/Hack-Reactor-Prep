 /*FIRST REVERSE
 Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order. 

There exist several built-in functions in almost all languages that reverse a string for you very easily, 
so we'll cover how to first reverse a string manually and then we'll show you how to do it using built-in functions.

A simple way to reverse a string would be to create a new string and fill it with the characters from the original
string, but backwards. To do this, we need to loop through the original string starting from the end, and every 
iteration of the loop we move to the previous character in the string. Here is an example:*/


function FirstReverse(str) { 

  var newString = "";

  for (var i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {   
    // add each character to newString
    newString = newString + str.charAt(i);
  }

  return newString;
         
}
   
FirstReverse("I am a string that needs to be reversed");  

Below is code that shows how to achieve this using built-in string and array functions.

function FirstReverse(str) { 

  // first we split the string which creates an array of characters, e.g. ['c','a','t']
  // then we call the reverse function on this array 
  // and finally we turn the reversed array back into a string using the join function
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
         
}
   
FirstReverse("I am a string that needs to be reversed");
