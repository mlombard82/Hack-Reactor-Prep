Changing Expectations - Cat Clicker Requirements.

Resources

In case you need a refresher on events and event listeners, here are some links.

If you're writing Cat Clicker with vanilla JS (no jQuery), you'll be adding the "click" event with elem.addEventListener().

var elem = document.getElementById('my-elem');
elem.addEventListener('click', function(){
  //the element has been clicked... do stuff here
}, false);

If you're using jQuery, you'll be adding the "click" event listener with jQuery.click().

$('#my-elem').click(function(e) {
  //the element has been clicked... do stuff here
});
 
 
 Changing Expectations - Andy's Reflections 2.
 
 "When you are adding event listeners to several elements, IN A CLOSURE, inside a loop, there is an easy trap you can
 fall into. But when could you fall into that trap? How to get out of it?"
 
 Closures and Event Listeners  (https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud989/l-3437288625/e-3415019302/m-3426659301)
The problem:

Let's say we're making an element for every item in an array. When each is clicked, it should alert its number. The simple approach would be to use a for loop to iterate over the list elements, and when the click happens, alert the value of num as we iterate over each item of the array. Here's an example:

// clear the screen for testing
document.body.innerHTML = '';
document.body.style.background="white";

var nums = [1,2,3];

// Let's loop over the numbers in our array
for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

    // This is the number we're on...
    var num = nums[i];

    // We're creating a DOM element for the number
    var elem = document.createElement('div');
    elem.textContent = num;

    // ... and when we click, alert the value of `num`
    elem.addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert(num);
    });

    // finally, let's add this element to the document
    document.body.appendChild(elem);
};
If you run this code on any website, it will clear everything and add a bunch of numbers to the page. Try it! Open a new page, open the console, and run the above code. Then click on the numbers and see what gets alerted. Reading the code, we'd expect the numbers to alert their values when we click on them.

But when we test it, all the elements alert the same thing: the last number. But why?

What's actually happening

Let's cut out the irrelevant code so we can see what's going on. The comments below have changed, and explain what is actually happening.

var nums = [1,2,3];

for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

    // This variable keeps changing every time we iterate!
    //  It's first value is 1, then 2, then finally 3.
    var num = nums[i];

    // On click...
    elem.addEventListener('click', function() {

        // ... alert num's value at the moment of the click!
        alert(num);

        // Specifically, we're alerting the num variable 
        // that's defined outside of this inner function.
        // Each of these inner functions are pointing to the
        // same `num` variable... the one that changes on
        // each iteration, and which equals 3 at the end of 
        // the for loop.  Whenever the anonymous function is
        // called on the click event, the function will
        //  reference the same `num` (which now equals 3).

    });

};
That's why regardless of which number we click on, they all alert the last value of num.

How do we fix it?

The solution involves utilizing closures. We're going to create an inner scope to hold the value of num at the exact moment we add the event listener. There are a number of ways to do this -- here's a good one.

Let's simplify the code to just the lines where we add the event listener.

var num = nums[i];

elem.addEventListener('click', function() {

    alert(num);

});
The num variable changes, so we have to somehow connect it to our event listener function. Here's one way of doing it. First take a look at this code, then I'll explain how it works.

elem.addEventListener('click', (function(numCopy) {
    return function() {
        alert(numCopy)
    };
})(num));
The bolded part is the outer function. We immediately invoke it by wrapping it in parentheses and calling it right away, passing in num. This method of wrapping an anonymous function in parentheses and calling it right away is called an IIFE (Immediately-Invoked Function Expression, pronounced like "iffy"). This is where the "magical" part happens.

We're passing the value of num into our outer function. Inside that outer function, the value is known as numCopy -- aptly named, since it's a copy of num in that instant. Now it doesn't matter that num changes later down the line. We stored the value of num in numCopy inside our outer function.

Lastly, the outer function returns the inner function to the event listener. Because of the way JavaScript scope works, that inner function has access to numCopy. In the near future, num will increment, but that doesn't matter. The inner function has access to numCopy, which will never change.

Now, when someone clicks, it'll execute the returned inner function, alerting numCopy.

The Final Version

Here's our original code, but fixed up with our closure trick. Test it out!

// clear the screen for testing
document.body.innerHTML = '';

var nums = [1,2,3];

// Let's loop over the numbers in our array
for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

    // This is the number we're on...
    var num = nums[i];

    // We're creating a DOM element for the number
    var elem = document.createElement('div');
    elem.textContent = num;

    // ... and when we click, alert the value of `num`
    elem.addEventListener('click', (function(numCopy) {
        return function() {
            alert(numCopy);
        };
    })(num));

    document.body.appendChild(elem);
};



Changing Expectations - Introduction to MVO

No matter what the size of the application, developers like to organize things in a few buckets. 
VIEW: This is all the stuff the user sees and interacts with. that includes DOM elements, input elements, buttons,
      and images. Basically, this is the UI to the application both, for giving your application data and for reading data.
      
MODEL: Where all the data is stored. That includes data from the server and from the user.

OCTOPUS: the model and the view are connected by octopus, providing SEPARATION OF CONCERNS. Think of OCTOPUS as the thing
        that holds things together, but keeps them separate enough to allow changes in individual pieces without
        upseting the rest.


REFACTORING WITH SEPARATION OF CONCERNS - ANDY'S CODE (1 & 2)

how is Andy displaying the cats when you click each of the buttons at the top?


Yes! Andy is keeping a completely separate view for each cat, and just showing and hiding them depending on which cat is selected. Although it works, it's not the best solution. (If we had 1000 cats, we'd have 1000 DOM nodes too, which is overkill.




REFACTORING WITH SEPARATION OF CONCERNS - REFACTORING THE RESUME
Any project that updates the DOM based on data using JS, can be refactored to use separation of concerns.
