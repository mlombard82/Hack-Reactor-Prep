The match() method searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns the matches, as an Array object.

Note: If the regular expression does not include the g modifier (to perform a global search), the match() method
will return only the first match in the string.

This method returns null if no match is found.

Syntax
string.match(regexp)

Parameter	Description
regexp	Required. The value to search for, as a regular expression.

Return Value:	An Array, containing the matches, one item for each match, or null if no match is found.



Example

Search a string for "ain":

var str = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain"; 
var res = str.match(/ain/g);
console.log(res);

// ["ain", "ain", "ain"]

Example

Perform a global, case-insensitive search for "ain":

var str = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain"; 
var res = str.match(/ain/gi);
console.log(res);

// ["ain", "AIN", "ain", "ain"]
