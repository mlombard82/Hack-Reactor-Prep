Extract characters from a string:



var str = "Hello world!";

var res = str.substring(1, 4);

console.log(res);

// ell


The substring() method extracts the characters from a string, between two specified indices, and returns the new sub string.
This method extracts the characters in a string between "start" and "end", not including "end" itself.

If "start" is greater than "end", this method will swap the two arguments, meaning str.substring(1,4) == str.substring(4,1).

If either "start" or "stop" is less than 0, it is treated as if it were 0.

Note: The substring() method does not change the original string.



Syntax
string.substring(start,end)
