/*there are various http verbs. 2 of the key ones are GET and POST
the 'dataType: 'jsonp' thing has to do with how the meetup API works.

what we are trying to get at, is we are asking the meetup API, please give me all of your cities.







Brian expands on his first AJAX example by displaying the data in a more readable format. Rather than showing the raw JSON data returned from the server, Brian parses the data and shows the city and state.
http://codepen.io/btholt/pen/mjBkq

In the JS here, using APPEND we are saying: please preserve what is already there and keep adding places. if we had used HTML instead, it would have displayed only the last element.

if instead of just city & state I wanted to display all the data regarding cities: */


success: function(data) {
      $('.text').html('');
      for (var i = 0; i < data.results.length; i++) {

        var cityObject = data.results[i];
        var place = "";
        for(var prop in cityObject){
          if(cityObject.hasOwnProperty(prop)){
            place += prop + "-" + cityObject[prop] + " ";
          }
        }
        //var place = data.results[i].city + ", " + data.results[i].state
        $('.text').append('<p>' + place + '</p>');
      }
      
    },
    dataType: 'jsonp',
  });
  
});










Reddit API (Aww pics - puppies)

In this exercise, you will use the Reddit API to search the “aww” subreddit for pictures of puppies and display them in your web application.

If you want to see the API documentation, it’s here: http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search
Open the CodePen http://codepen.io/btholt/pen/Aejsl
Hints:
Solution: http://codepen.io/btholt/pen/fErah
You’ll need the jQuery methods .click(), .append(), and .ajax()
You shouldn’t need to touch HTML or CSS.
The data is fairly nested. The data that concerns you is data.children[i].data.thumbnail. children is an array you’ll loop over.

YOU HAVE THE SOLUTION IN CODEPEN. here he is how Bryan did it classroom:

As the meetup API example, this code will just spit raw JSON

$('.btn').click(function() {
  
  $('.text').text('loading . . .');
  
  $.ajax({
    type:"GET",
    url:"http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/search.json?q=puppy&restrict_sr=true",
    success: function(data) {
      $('.text').text(JSON.stringify(data));
    },
  });
  
});



// what we ended up with in the classroom

$('.btn').click(function() {
  
  $('.text').text('loading . . .');
  
  $.ajax({
    type:"GET",
    url:"http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/search.json?q=puppy&restrict_sr=true",
    success: function(response) {
      $('.text').text('');
      for(var i = 0; i < response.data.children.length; i++){
        var image = "<img src='" + response.data.children[i].data.thumbnail + "'/>";
        $('.text').append(image);
      }
    },
  });
  
});
});
