/*there are various http verbs. 2 of the key ones are GET and POST
the 'dataType: 'jsonp' thing has to do with how the meetup API works.

what we are trying to get at, is we are asking the meetup API, please give me all of your cities.







Brian expands on his first AJAX example by displaying the data in a more readable format. Rather than showing the raw JSON data returned from the server, Brian parses the data and shows the city and state.

In the JS here, using APPEND we are saying: please preserve what is already there and keep adding places. if we had used HTML instead, it would have displayed only the last element.

if instead of just city & state I wanted to display all the data regarding cities: */


success: function(data) {
      $('.text').html('');
      for (var i = 0; i < data.results.length; i++) {

        var cityObject = data.results[i];
        var place = "";
        for(var prop in cityObject){
          if(cityObject.hasOwnProperty(prop)){
            place += prop + "-" + cityObject[prop] + " ";
          }
        }
        //var place = data.results[i].city + ", " + data.results[i].state
        $('.text').append('<p>' + place + '</p>');
      }
      
    },
    dataType: 'jsonp',
  });
  
});
