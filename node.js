Node.js is a platform for running JavaScript on the server. Rather than use server-side 
languages like PHP or Python, you can use JavaScript. After introducing Node.js, Brian 
walks through a “Hello World” exercise.

node.js takes Google Chrome’s JavaScript engine (V8) and uses it to control libenv, a library
 that allows you to create and run a server. It’s super rad and pretty fast.

 We’re going to use JS to code the server. This is useful because you only need to learn
  one language
You’re using node.js instead of Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, etc.
node.js is quite different from other server-side languages.
