forEach

[1,2,3].forEach(x => console.log(x)) // takes a function and applies it to every item in an array.

//1
//2
//3


Map  // takes a function and applies it to every item in a collection, creating a new value and then creating a NEW ARRAY
     //with the results
     
[1,2,3].map(x => x + 1)        

// [2, 3, 4]


Filter   // Applies a test function. Only if that value passes the test will it make it into the NEW collection.

[1,2,3].filter(x => x > 1)

//[2, 3]


concatAll() // flattens an array by one- dimension. Not a JS native function.
