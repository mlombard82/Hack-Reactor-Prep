Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length property of the object upon
which the method was called.

syntax: arr.push(element1,....,elementN)

the push() method appends values to an array. it is intentionally generic. can be used with 'call' or 'apply' on
objects resembling arrays. the push method relies on a length property to determine where to start inserting the
given values. if the length property cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0. if length is
nonexistent, then it will be created.

Adding elements to an array

var sports = ['soccer', 'baseball'];
var total = sports.push('football', 'swimming');
console.log(sports);
console.log(total);
//["soccer", "baseball", "football", "swimming"]
//4


Merging two arrays. This example uses apply() to push all elements from a second array.
var vegetables = ['parsnip', 'potato'];
var moreVegs = ['celery', 'beetroot'];

// merge the second array into the first one. Equivalent to vegetables.push('celery', 'beetroot');

Array.prototype.push.apply(vegetables, moreVegs);
console.log(vegetables);

//["parsnip", "potato", "celery", "beetroot"]
