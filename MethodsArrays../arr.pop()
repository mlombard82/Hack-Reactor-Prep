Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

syntax: arr.pop()

description: the pop method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller.
it is intentionally generic; the method can be called or applied to objects resembling arrays. Objects which do not
contain a 'length' property reflecting the last in a series of consecutive, zero-based numerical properties may not
behave in a meaningful manner.
if you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined.

this code creates the myFish array containing 4 elements, then removes its last:


var myFish = ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'sturgeon'];
console.log(myFish); // ["angel", "clown", "mandarin", "sturgeon"]
var popped = myFish.pop();
console.log(myFish); // ["angel", "clown", "mandarin"]
console.log(popped); // "sturgeon"
